# Web-API-Quiz
## Project Description
This project challenges us to use web api and javascript to create a quiz. My motivation behind this was to create a simple index.html layout and use a simple layout to create the game.  I built this project so I can understand how api's work.   I also had to use javascript to remove or add actual objects on the page. The problem this challenge solves is I can use web/apis like event listeners to add to my function. I learned how to remove semantic elements through javascript and also how to store information and display it through variables and assinging to a value. My project stands out because I tried my best to make it the most efficient line of code.

## Installation
